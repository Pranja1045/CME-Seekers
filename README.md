## Introduction

Magnetic reconnection is an important phenomenon in space physics, and this Python script allows you to analyze the frequency of magnetic reconnections based on data from a text file. The code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI application where you can specify a year, and it will display the number of magnetic reconnections for that year based on the provided data file.
Requirements

To use this code, you need the following requirements:

    Python 3.x installed on your system.
    The Tkinter library, which is usually included with Python.

## Installation

You can clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

### bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/magnetic-reconnection-frequency.git

### Usage

    Make sure you have the required Python and Tkinter library installed.

    Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:

    bash

cd magnetic-reconnection-frequency

Run the Python script:

### bash

    python magnetic_reconnection.py

    The GUI window will open, allowing you to perform the following steps:

        Enter the year for which you want to find the frequency of magnetic reconnections in the "Enter Year" field.

        Click the "Fetch Data" button to calculate and display the number of magnetic reconnections for the specified year.

        The results will be displayed in the listbox below the button.

    You can analyze different years by entering a new year and clicking the "Fetch Data" button again.
